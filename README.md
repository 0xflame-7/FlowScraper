# ScrapeFlow - Learning Build

This repository is a personal, step-by-step implementation of the **ScrapeFlow** project from [Kliton Bare's tutorial](https://dub.sh/scrapeflow). The app is a full-stack SaaS platform for automating web scraping using a visual workflow builder powered by **React Flow**.

üîß **Tech Stack**:

- **Next.js** ‚Äì Full-stack React framework
- **TypeScript** ‚Äì Strongly typed JavaScript
- **React Flow** ‚Äì Visual node-based flow editor
- **Prisma** ‚Äì ORM for PostgreSQL
- **React Query** ‚Äì Data fetching and caching
- **Clerk** ‚Äì Authentication
- **Stripe** ‚Äì Billing and subscriptions

üìö **Purpose**:
This project is for learning full-stack SaaS architecture with visual editors and scraping automation. Future plans include:

- Adding new task types
- Integrating custom AI-powered data extraction
- Designing my own workflow UI/UX
- Making it production-ready

üí° **Original Project**:  
Built by following [ScrapeFlow by Kliton](https://github.com/kliton-yt/scrape-flow) ‚Äî all credits to the original author. This version will evolve into a customized, feature-rich version over time.
